        <!-- Slide 4: Literature Review -->
        <div class="slide hide-slide">
            <h1>Literature Review</h1>
            <p>Our research into existing online bookselling platforms reveals both strengths and weaknesses. While established players like Amazon, OLX, and ThriftBooks exist, they each face unique challenges when it comes to offering comprehensive book listings and facilitating bulk transactions.</p>
            <p>Amazon, a major player in the market, is primarily designed for individual sales, making bulk transactions for used books a complex process. Moreover, the platform's fees can be a significant barrier for sellers of low-cost used books.</p>
            <p>OLX provides a simple listing process but lacks a dedicated book section, hindering buyers' ability to discover specific titles. Furthermore, the platform does not cater effectively to the needs of bulk buyers and sellers.</p>
            <p>ThriftBooks excels in offering a vast selection of used books, but its focus on institutional sales makes it less accessible for individual sellers and smaller suppliers, such as scrap collectors.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Challenges in Bulk Book Transactions -->
        <div class="slide hide-slide">
            <h1>Challenges in Bulk Book Transactions</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>High fees, inadequate inventory management, and lack of support for large-scale transactions are common issues that plague current online book buying platforms.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 6: Novel Nest Differentiation -->

        <!-- Slide 7: Methodology -->
        <div class="slide hide-slide">
            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>Our platform employs a robust technical architecture to deliver a seamless user experience. The frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and interactive interface, enabling smooth navigation and feature access. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles crucial functionalities such as user authentication, transaction processing, and user interactions.</p>
            <p>To manage dynamic data efficiently, we leverage MongoDB, a scalable and flexible NoSQL database. MongoDB stores user information, book listings, and purchase records, ensuring data storage is both efficient and accommodates the platform's growing needs.</p>
